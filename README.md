# Data cleaning tools

This package contains tools that help you understand your data and manipulate multiple datasets.

Functionality has been grouped into classes, OOP style, for a more streamlined workflow and so method 'chaining' can be done.

This makes it easier to conduct relational analysis across multiple datasets, e.g. joins.


## Next steps:

1. Include example data files and workflow
2. Tidy up codebase
3. Write up unit tests
4. Research other data standardisation/normalisation methods
5. Error handling
6. Expand database coverage, e.g. SQLite
7. Evaluation section, e.g. can I achieve the same outcome in a more functional style?; comparisons with 'R'
